        <h1>Sheperds pie</h1>
        <p>Its a hearty dish with origins in the <b><u><i>United Kingdom and Ireland</i></u></b>and is composed of a <u>ground meat cooked in gravy, onions, carrots, celery, and a mashed potato crust.</u> It was a way for folks to make use of leftovers, in order to avoid waste, both of the food and money varieties. Sometime in the 18th century, a dish called <em>“cottage pie”</em> came about. This cottage pie was the precursor to shepherds pie, which was coined in the middle of the 19th century. <strong>The name "sheperds pie" first appeared in an English cookbook in 1877.</strong></p>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain</li>
        <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid</li>

        <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined</li>
        <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer</li>
        <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes.** Cool for 15 minutes before serving</li>
